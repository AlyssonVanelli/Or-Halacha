SIMAN 170

1. A yabam (brother-in-law) who gives a get (divorce document) to the yevama (sister-in-law) disqualifies her and her co-wives from yibum (levirate marriage) with him and with the other brothers, according to rabbinic law. Any get that disqualifies a wife from marrying a kohen (priest) also disqualifies a yevama from yibum, and she is not permitted to marry a stranger until he performs chalitza (ceremonial release).

2. Similarly, the ma'amar (a rabbinic act of betrothal for a yevama, as the Torah acquisition is through intercourse alone) does not create a complete acquisition. If he wishes to release her after the ma'amar, she requires a get for the ma'amar and chalitza to dissolve the bond.

3. Since the ma'amar does not create a complete acquisition and the get does not completely dismiss, therefore, subsequent actions are effective, whether it is a get after a get, a ma'amar after a ma'amar, or a get and chalitza and intercourse after the ma'amar, or a ma'amar and intercourse and chalitza after a get, whether with one yabam and two yevamot, or with one yevama and two yabams, or with two yevamot and two yabams.

4. How so? A yabam who gives a get to his yevama and then gives a get to her co-wife becomes prohibited to the relatives of both. Or if two yabams give a get to one yevama, one after the other, both become prohibited to her relatives. Or if two yabams and two yevamot, each gives a get to one, each becomes prohibited to the relatives of the one to whom he gave a get.

5. When they come to release her, according to the opinion that a defective chalitza requires going back to all the brothers, in the case of two yabams and one yevama, she requires chalitza from each one. And there is an opinion that the same applies to one yabam and two yevamot, and if he gave a get to both, he must perform chalitza for both. According to the opinion that a defective chalitza does not require going back to all the brothers, even with two yabams and one yevama, one chalitza suffices. (Note: The Rosh agreed with this. The reason a defective chalitza requires going back is that she was fully bound and became disqualified when the bond weakened, but a defective chalitza from the outset does not require going back.)

6. Similarly, there is a ma'amar after a ma'amar. If he performed a ma'amar with one and then with another, or brothers performed a ma'amar with her or her co-wife, each requires a get for the ma'amar, and chalitza for one of them to release both. Similarly, if he performed a ma'amar with one and then gave a get or performed chalitza for her or her co-wife, or had intercourse with her co-wife, or after his ma'amar, his brother gave her a get or performed chalitza for her or her co-wife, or had intercourse with her or her co-wife, what was done after the ma'amar is effective to prohibit the one with the ma'amar and to prohibit her relatives by the action done after the ma'amar, and to require a get for the ma'amar and intercourse done after it.

7. This is their enactment: If he performed a ma'amar with her and gave her a get, she requires chalitza. If he performed a ma'amar and performed chalitza, she requires a get. If he performed a ma'amar with one and gave a get to another, he gives a get to the one with the ma'amar, and he or his brother performs chalitza for one of them, and the other is released. There is an opinion that both require chalitza.

8. If he performed a ma'amar with one and he or his brother had intercourse with the one with the ma'amar, she requires a get, and the second one also requires a get, and he must perform chalitza for one of them.

9. Similarly, if he gave her a get and then had intercourse with her or performed a ma'amar with her or her co-wife, or performed chalitza for her co-wife, or after his get, his brother performed a ma'amar with her or had intercourse with her or performed chalitza for her or her co-wife, what was done after the get is effective to prohibit her relatives and to require a get for the ma'amar done after it.

10. This is their enactment: If he gave her a get and then had intercourse with her or performed a ma'amar with her, she requires a get and chalitza.

11. If he gave her a get and then he or his brother had intercourse with her co-wife or performed a ma'amar with her, the one with whom he had intercourse or performed a ma'amar requires a get, and he must perform chalitza for one of them to release both.

12. Intercourse creates a complete acquisition, and chalitza completely dismisses. Therefore, actions done after them are not effective to disqualify her or to prohibit her relatives. How so? If he had intercourse with his yevama and then he or his brother performed chalitza for her or her co-wife, that chalitza is nothing. Similarly, if his brother gave a get to her or her co-wife, it is nothing. Similarly, if he performed a ma'amar with her or had intercourse, it is nothing. However, if he or his brother had intercourse with her co-wife or performed a ma'amar with her, she requires a get.

13. Similarly, if he performed chalitza for his yevama and then he or his brother performed chalitza for her co-wife, that chalitza is nothing to prohibit her relatives. Or if two yabams performed chalitza for one yevama, one after the other, the last chalitza is nothing, and he is permitted to her relatives. However, if after he performed chalitza for his yevama, he or his brother had intercourse or betrothed her or her co-wife, the betrothal is valid, and she requires a get, whether he betrothed her for marriage, such as betrothing her without specification, or for yibum, such as saying to her, "You are betrothed to me for the bond of yibum."

14. The rule that actions are not effective after valid intercourse applies specifically to valid intercourse that was not preceded by another action. However, invalid intercourse, such as giving a get to one and having intercourse with another, or performing a ma'amar with one and having intercourse with another, allows subsequent actions to be effective. If he or his brother performs chalitza for a third, they become prohibited to her relatives, and she is not released with just a get, as the bond still remains. However, chalitza, even if it is invalid because it was preceded by another action, such as giving a get to one or a ma'amar to another and then performing chalitza for her or her co-wife, does not allow subsequent actions to be effective. If he or his brother performs chalitza for her or her co-wife, it is nothing. However, if he or his brother had intercourse or betrothed her, the betrothal is valid.

15. If he performed a ma'amar with his yevama and then gave her a get for her bond, he disqualifies her and all the brothers, and she requires a get for her ma'amar and chalitza for her bond. (If he gave her a get without specification, it is as if he specified for her bond.) If he gave her a get for her ma'amar and not for her bond, she remains bound as she was, and she is only permitted to the other brothers, but the one who divorced her is prohibited to her. Some say she is permitted even to the one who divorced her.

16. The intercourse of a nine-year-old is like the ma'amar of an adult. Therefore, if he had intercourse with the yevama, he disqualifies her for all the brothers. If after he had intercourse with her, his older brother had intercourse with her or her co-wife, or performed a ma'amar or gave a get or performed chalitza for her or her co-wife, he disqualifies her for the minor. Similarly, if the minor had intercourse with her co-wife or his brother, a nine-year-old, had intercourse with her or her co-wife, he disqualifies her for him, as with a ma'amar after a ma'amar. Similarly, if the adult performed a ma'amar with the yevama and his nine-year-old brother had intercourse with her or her co-wife, he disqualifies her as with a ma'amar after a ma'amar. The ma'amar of a nine-year-old is not considered like the ma'amar of an adult and is only effective at the beginning, not at the end. How so? If a minor performed a ma'amar, it is effective to disqualify her for the brothers. However, if the adult performed a ma'amar and the nine-year-old performed a ma'amar with her or her co-wife, it is not effective to disqualify her for the adult brother. But the ma'amar of a nine-year-old after the ma'amar of a nine-year-old, there is reason to say it is effective since the first ma'amar was from a nine-year-old. A get and chalitza have no effect for a minor, neither at the beginning nor at the end.

17. An adult who performed a ma'amar with a yevama or gave her a get, and she has a co-wife, when he comes to perform chalitza for one of them to release them, the chalitza of the one with the get or the one with the ma'amar does not release the co-wife. However, the chalitza of the co-wife releases the one with the get completely and the one with the ma'amar from chalitza, and she still requires a get for her ma'amar. If he performed a ma'amar with one and gave a get to another, he performs chalitza for whichever he wishes and releases the second, as explained.

18. If two yevamot fall before him from one house, one is a secondary prohibition to the yabam, and the other is permitted. When he performs yibum, he performs yibum with the permitted one. When he performs chalitza, he performs chalitza for the secondary prohibition. There is an opinion that if he performed chalitza for the prohibited one, her co-wife is not released. If he performed chalitza for the co-wife, the prohibited one is released.

19. Many yevamot coming from one house, once one of them has valid intercourse or has a superior chalitza, all are released, and the bond of the yabam is removed from them. If one of them had invalid intercourse or was given an invalid ma'amar, all are prohibited from yibum, and the one who had intercourse or was given a ma'amar requires a get. Each one requires chalitza to permit her to a stranger, as the bond of the yabam is not removed by inferior intercourse. If one of them had inferior chalitza, she is permitted to marry a stranger, but her co-wife is prohibited until she also performs chalitza, or until all the brothers perform chalitza for the first one who had inferior chalitza, as inferior chalitza does not remove the bond of yibum from this house until she goes back to all the brothers or until each one performs chalitza. This is the opinion of the Rambam, and there is a dispute about it, as explained in the words of the Tur.

20. Two yabams who performed yibum with two yevamot coming from one house, and it is not known who performed yibum first, both must release with a get, and they are permitted to strangers, to Israelites, and prohibited to the yabams. Therefore, Reuven, who had two wives, one in Akko and one in Tzur, and Shimon and Levi, his brothers, one in Akko and one in Tzur, and they heard that Reuven died, neither should perform yibum until they know what his brother did. If one of them performed yibum first, it is not taken from him until it is known that his brother performed yibum first.


--- EXPLICAÇÃO PRÁTICA ---

Para entender o Siman 170 do Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer, precisamos primeiro compreender alguns conceitos básicos do judaísmo relacionados ao casamento levirato, conhecido como "yibum", e seus procedimentos associados, como "chalitza" e "ma'amar".

1. **Yibum e Chalitza**: Quando um homem casado morre sem deixar filhos, a lei judaica tradicionalmente prevê que seu irmão deve se casar com a viúva, um ato chamado "yibum". Se o irmão não deseja se casar com a viúva, ele deve realizar um ritual chamado "chalitza", que libera a viúva para se casar com outra pessoa.

2. **Get**: É um documento de divórcio. No contexto de yibum, se o irmão dá um get à viúva, ele a desqualifica para o yibum, tanto para ele quanto para os outros irmãos.

3. **Ma'amar**: É um ato rabínico de noivado com a viúva, que não completa o casamento, mas cria um vínculo que precisa ser dissolvido com um get e chalitza.

Agora, vamos explicar as seções do texto:

1. **Desqualificação com Get**: Se o irmão dá um get à viúva, ela e suas co-esposas ficam desqualificadas para o yibum com ele e com os outros irmãos. Ela não pode se casar com outra pessoa até que a chalitza seja realizada.

2. **Ma'amar e sua Incompletude**: O ma'amar não completa o casamento. Se o irmão deseja liberar a viúva após o ma'amar, ele precisa dar um get para o ma'amar e realizar a chalitza.

3. **Ações Subsequentes**: Como o ma'amar e o get não são ações completas, outras ações podem ser realizadas depois, como dar um segundo get ou realizar outro ma'amar.

4. **Proibições Relativas**: Se um irmão dá um get à viúva e depois a outro irmão, ambos ficam proibidos de se casar com parentes da viúva.

5. **Chalitza Defeituosa**: Se a chalitza é considerada defeituosa, pode ser necessário que todos os irmãos realizem a chalitza. Há opiniões divergentes sobre quando isso é necessário.

6. **Ma'amar Após Ma'amar**: Se um ma'amar é seguido por outro, cada um requer um get, e a chalitza é necessária para liberar a viúva.

7. **Enactamentos Rabínicos**: Se um ma'amar é seguido por um get, a chalitza ainda é necessária. Se um ma'amar é seguido por chalitza, um get ainda é necessário.

8. **Intercurso Completo**: O intercurso completa o casamento, e a chalitza dissolve completamente o vínculo. Ações após essas não têm efeito.

9. **Intercurso Inválido**: Se o intercurso é precedido por um get ou ma'amar, ações subsequentes podem ser eficazes.

10. **Casos Especiais**: Existem regras específicas para casos envolvendo menores de idade e múltiplos irmãos ou viúvas.

Essas leis são complexas e refletem a tentativa de equilibrar a tradição com a necessidade de resolver situações familiares complicadas. Na prática contemporânea, muitos judeus seguem essas leis com a orientação de autoridades rabínicas, especialmente em comunidades que mantêm práticas tradicionais.
